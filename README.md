It leverages PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption to provide end-to-end encryption for all your messages. Connect it to your Gmail account or other IMAP server, and it will focus on PGP encrypted emails ONLY, ignoring the rest - making SMC the perfect choice for everyone who values digital privacy.
